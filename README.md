# Breadth-First Search

### Background 
Breadth-first search is an algorithm for searching tree or graph data structures. 

Trees are a hierarchical model, they only allow one path (edge) between any two vertices.

Graphs are a network model, they allow both uni-directional and or bi-directional paths (edges) between nodes.


### Implementation 
Searches a static set of arrays for a name that ends in a certain character.

It starts at the tree root and then explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth, prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.
